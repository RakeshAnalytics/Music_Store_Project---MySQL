# Music_Store_Project---MySQL
In this project, I used MySQL to analyze a music store database. The dataset includes information on customers, invoices, artists, albums, tracks, genres, employees, and sales data. The goal was to extract key business insights related to customer behavior, sales trends, and music preferences.
